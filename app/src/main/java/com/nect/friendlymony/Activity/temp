  the FriendlyMony's Privacy policy and Terms links need proper redirections;
  currently it incorrect. screenshot attached Please redirect it accordingly to :

5 Web) When we create new accounts, in the matching profile feeds, this account appears 3 to 4 times and if this person expresses interest
     interest then in her 'Who liked my profile' screen again appear multiple no. of times.

   Say Create an account 'A' male interested in Female and then another account 'B' Female interested in Male.
   Then if we login to A's account then the B's profile appears more than once in his feed.  Again, if A expresses
    interest in B's profile then under the B's profile 'Who liked me' the profile of 'A' appears multiple no. of times.

  For any type of account, It should create only one profile and hence should appear only once in its matching Feeds.

6 Done) In the profile details screen, there is ' Start Chatting'  This 'Start chatting' option should not appear there. We should display
     the 'X', Smile/Crush' and 'Heart' icons as it appears in the by default screen of the profile in the feed.  screenshot aattached.

    ( Chatting is possible ONLY WHEN say A expresses interest/ or Send Crushes and B accepts that Interest or Crushes. In this
     conditions, it will be a " Match" and since match is established then they can chat/video call etc.  UNTILL and UNLESS
     Expression of Interest is accepted or Crushes is accepted, they can't  CHAT or VIdeo Call ).

7 Done) When we Sign up with Apple ID, we should auto fille the First Name, Last name and Email Id of the user in the Sign up
    screen as we already have these info from the Apple API. Currently all these fields appear blank and the user has to manually
    fill them all over again. screenshot attached.

8 Discuss with client) In the Apple Signup/Login screen, if we tap on the " Forgot your Apple ID or Password?"  or ' See How Your data is managed..."
    then it does not respond. screenshot attached.

9 Done) Tap on ' Continue with Apple' then tap on the Back button of the device to come out of this screen ;
     then instead of taking to the Dashboard of the App, it shows a BLANK screen and if we again Tap on the Back
     button on the device then only it shows the Dashboard/ login screen of the App.
     ( On the First tapping of the Back button of the device should show the Dashboard/ Login screen)

10 Done) While trying to Sign up/ login with Apple ID, in the next screen, "Do you want to continue using..."
      in this screen if we tap on the 'Cancel' button then it shows a BLANK screen and we have to tap again on the Back
     icon to go to the Dashboard of the App.  screenshot attached.
     ( On Tapping on ' Cancel' it should directly take us to the Dashboard/Login screen of the App)

11 Web) After creating and account with Apple Id, if we logout of the Account and then try to login again
      then instead of logging into the Account, it again shows the Sign up screen as if no such account exists in DB
      BUT this created account gets recorded in the Admin panel.

12 Web) In the Admin panel, for the account created using  Apple ID , it gets recorded in the Admin panel
       under the ' Networking Type' as Mobile number. It should get recorded as ' Apple ID'.

13 Web) For any type of account created, using FB, Gmail or Apple ID, in the Admin panel the profile pictures DO NOT Appear.
      In the Admin panel, it should appear under the Edit section the user. ( Eg; http://3.15.38.50/admin/admin/users/442/edit)

14 Web) The blocking of the user does not work as expected.
      Say when  'A' blocks ' B' from his feed then 'B' continues to appear on ' A's ' Feed.
      (here, we should immediately remove the profile of B from the feeds of A's ).
      Now Again, under the B's feed , the profile of A still continues to appear asusual.
      (here since A has already blocked him, the profile of A should not appear at all under B feeds).

15 Done) When we try to report to the Admin to block a user, the UI/UX should be similar to the Woo App as
      screenshot attached. ( Should show all the options in the screen by default with radio button option
      to select any one of these options. ' Other' field should also be available so that he can write his own reason
      for blocking the account.

16 Web) Similarly to Blocking an User ,
      say if A reports about B to the Admin to block him then B should immediately disappear/ get hidden from the feed of A
      and in the feed of B, the profile of A should not appear at all.
      (currently, even when A reports to Admin to Block B , his profile continues to appear in his feed and
        in the feed of B the profile of A still appears )

17 Web) In the Admin panel, (http://3.15.38.50/admin/admin/userReports)

       we should also record the user id of the user with HYPERLINK about whom the report is received so
        that the Admin can quickly check his profile details and types of photos uploaded. It will help him
        in deciding whether to block the user or not depending upon the profile description and uploaded photos.
        ( At present there is no way in helping him to understand the issue).

       Also, all the new reported users should appear on top in the Admin panel ( latest should appear on top and older below it.)

       Badge Icon for the UNREAD Messages on the USER REPORT heading. screenshot attached.

18 Web) From the Admin panel, when the Admin BLOCKS the user then also he is able to login to his account as usual.
      He should not be allowed to login to his account and his profile MUST be hidden on the entire platform/ App.

     Say when he tries to login to his account, in the DASHBOARD we need to display the message:
      " Your account has been blocked for Terms violations. Please contact support@friendlymony.com"
         This email id should be hyperlink so that user can compose mail and sends the request for review of the account.

      Say if he is in logged in state in the App and if the Admin blocks him then HE MUST BE LOGGED out automatically and
      if he tries to login again then we should display the above message.

    And once the Admin UNBLOCKS his account then his profile should be again visible on the entire platform and he should
    be able to use the platform as usaul like any other normal user.

   ( Currently BLOCKING itself does not work).


19 Web) Both Boosts and Crushes DO NOT have any expiry date and hence their payment is one time and NOT based on subscription
      as currently displayed in the plan. screenshot attached.

      It should be INR 75.25 instead of INR 75.25/mo , INR 227.27 instead of INR 27.27/mo  etc.
      similarly for Boosts , it should be INR 379.29 instead of INR 379.29/mo , INR 759.37 instead of 759.34/mo etc.

20 New) In the payment screen, on entering the CC number it is not detecting the type of card ( Visa / Master/ American Express etc.)

22 New) In the payment screen, we should show the total amount that is going to be charged in this screen before processing the payment
      for any type of payment ( Boost buy, Crushes buy or any subscription buy).
     Screenshot of an App (Meravyaah) is attached for your referennce. This App has Stripe payment gateway.
      You can download the App from the PlayStore and check.

23 New) Payment method showing currently ONLY USING CREDIT CARD, it should show options for
      Debit Card, Netbanking  Paytm etc.

24 New) We need to check the various payment methods by changing the country locations
      Say for US , it should show payment using  CC / DB card, Netbanking , Apple Pay etc.


25 Web) After creating an account even without buying any BOOSTS or when there is no BOOSTS available then also
      if we tap on the ' Boost Now'  then it displays 'Your profile will be boosted for 60 minutes'. (though it does not boosts it.)
      Since there is no BOOSTS available in his account, it should display message like
       " You do not have Boosts available. Please buy to Boost your profile"

26 Web) When we buy CRUSHES, though it shows the success message in the App but it fails to record in the Admin panel
      under the ' Crush Report' section and under the ' User Management' section.
       Under the user management section , it should show the total no. of Crushes bought, Spent and Left which is yet to be used. screen shot attached.

27 Web) When we buy BOOSTS, though it shows the success message in the App but it fails to record in the Admin panel
      under the ' Boost Report' section and under the ' User Management' section.
       Under the user management section , it should show the total no. of Boosts bought, Spent and Left which is yet to be used. screen shot attached.

28 Web) Unable to buy 50 BOOSTS ,as in the payment gateway screen, it shows invalid integer.

29 Web) Even with incorrect expiry date of CC and incorrect CVV number, we are able to buy BOOSTS and CRUSHES.
      there is no validity check of the CC and hence it processes the request as success.

30 Done) In the payments screen , instead of ' Subscription Payment' , we should simply mention its heading as ' Payment details'.

31 Web) Subscription plans means that just before the expiry of his current subscription plan 1 month/3months/6 months/12 months ,
      his CC/ Debit card etc. would be automatically charged and his subscription is auto-renewed.
      Hence, accordingly his account expiry date in the Admin panel under the user management section should updated automatically.
      Incase if his CC has expired OR he has Off the Auto-renewal option then it should reflect in the Admin panel accordingly.
      And once he becomes a FREE member ....he can't chat or make video call. This check needs to be provided so that
      a user once a paid member and then if he becomes a free men=ber after that then we should not allow him to Chat/ Video call.

32 Web) For the subscription plans ( 1 month/ 3 month/6 months and 12 months ), it fails to record it in the Admin panel under the ' Subscription Report'.
      It should record all the details similar to already present under it for the earlier users.

33 Web and mobile) When we subscribe for a plan say for 1 month , we should be able to buy again either 1 month plan or 3 months or 6 month or 12 months plan
     and the validy of the account should be as expected BUT  say after buying a 3 months plan we should not allow to buy 1 month plan
     ie; for for a subscriber with higher plan if he tries to subscribe to lower plan , we SHOULD NOT ALLOW and display message like
     " Please subscribe to  higher plan"
    similarly say if 1 has a subscription of 12 months plan then he cannot subscribe to either 1 month /3 months or 6 months plan as all these plans are lower than
     12 months plan.

      ( Currently since it allows to subscribe from higher plan to lower plan , hence the expiry date shows incorrectly in the Admin panel under EXPIRY DATE of user management         section)

34 New) Say today I created an account (14/4/2020) then it has a free validity of 7 days can fo up to 14 days incase if he has referred at least 5 users.
      Now, consider that he has a free validity of 7 days...then his account is valid till 20/4/2020.
      Now , if he subscribes today (14/4/2020) then his account should be valid till 19/5/2020  (7 days free + 30 days )

      Incase if he subscribe for 1 month plan after his 7 days free trial period say on 25/4/2020, then his account will be valid till 24/5/2020 (30 days because he has already
       used his free trial period and subscribed after his trial period)

     Similarly for all other plans 3 months, 6 months and 12 months  ...we need to Add 90 days /180 days and 365 days resp. from the day of subscription if it has
     been subscribed after the 7 days trial period OR no. of  free days left + 90/180/365 days etc...

35 Done) The Application Crashes if we try to Subscribe for 3 months or 6 months or 12 months plan.

36 Done) Say if I subscribe for a 3 months plan then the rate is INR 378.96/month
      so the total amount charged  should be INR 378.96*3=INR 1136.88
       but it charges only INR 378.96 .....ie; its not calculating the total no. of months in that subscription.

      All these total calculated amounts should appear in the payment details screen before the amount is  CC is charged / processed successfully.

     Similarly, for the other plans, it should calculate the total no. of months in the plan and then charge accordingly.
      Eg : say for 3 months @100  should be INR 100*3=INR 300
                         6 months @90   should be  INR 90*6 = INR 540
                         12 month @80   should be INR 80*12 = INR 960   etc.

37 Web) In the App also, in the subscription screen say for a 3 months plan , screennshot attached.
 it shows the validity/ My Plan as 91 days and paid amount as INR 378.96
 It should show the validity  as 90 days and paid amount as INR 1136.88  (378.96*3=1136.88)


Note : I have not checked the Chat /video call / Online status etc. and related features as the App in the other device is Crashing.
           Conditional cases like making the account created as backdate , by making an account expired / Cancelled /off the Auto-renewal etc.
           we can test once these issues are fixed and we are available at the same time so that DB dates can be changed and tested various conditions.


           ==================================Discuss with client==========================================
           7) When we Sign up with Apple ID, we should auto fille the First Name, Last name and Email Id of the user in the Sign up
               screen as we already have these info from the Apple API. Currently all these fields appear blank and the user has to manually
               fill them all over again. screenshot attached.(As per apple policy they share firstname,lastname and email only first time and after other time
               they share only apple id and client secret key)

           8) In the Apple Signup/Login screen, if we tap on the " Forgot your Apple ID or Password?"  or ' See How Your data is managed..."
               then it does not respond. screenshot attached.(This is webview and this webpage is apple so can't do on it.


               =========================================================================24-04-2020=======================================================================================

               1) In the profile details screen, the X , Crush Icon and Heart icon , on tapping on any of these , it shows ' Start chatting'
                   It should be like on tapping X...Rejected
                                                  tapping Crush icon ....Crush sent successfully
                                                  tapping on Heart icon...You have expressed your Interest successfully.


               Now, it simply displays the messages like 'sent successfully' but in fact it does not sent either Express Interest  (on tapping on Heart)
               OR Crush ( on tapping on Smiley Heart).
               Also, the messages should be ' Crush sent successfully' and ' You have expressed your Interest successfully'

               2) After Sign up with Apple ID, if we logout and then try to re-login then it again shows the Sign up screen.
                   (Though in the DB the account has been created successfully)

               3)   There is no Badge icon for the UNREAD/NEW Report Abuse in the Admin panel
                  (Badge Icon for the UNREAD Messages on the FLAGGING heading.).

               4)In the App setting screen, under My Plan , instead of showing as 37 days , 365days etc.
                   we should show as ' 1 Month' , ' 3 Months' , ' 6 Months' etc.  with the current  validity date of the account mentioned just below it.
                   screenshot attached.  Please mention the account validity like : "Valid Till: 23/04/2020 "

               5) NEED TO CHECK THIS CASE AT LAST :
                  Subscription plans means that just before the expiry of his current subscription plan 1 month/3months/6 months/12 months ,
                     his CC/ Debit card etc. would be automatically charged and his subscription is auto-renewed.
                     Hence, accordingly his account expiry date in the Admin panel under the user management section should updated automatically.
                     Incase if his CC has expired OR he has Off the Auto-renewal option then it should reflect in the Admin panel accordingly.
                     And once he becomes a FREE member ....he can't chat or make video call. This check needs to be provided so that
                     a user once a paid member and then if he becomes a free men=ber after that then we should not allow him to Chat/ Video call.

               6) Auto-Renewal ON/OFF case not checked ; will test it when we are available at the same time so that we can change the
                     dates in DB and test.

               7) In the Admin Panel. Dashboard : http://3.15.38.50/admin/admin/home
                      Here , the count for no. of Androif users, Male users , Female users , Total no. of users DO NOT appear correctly. ( count mismatch).

                     Also, the Monthly Income is not correctly displayed. It should be the sum of all the Crushes, Boosts and Plans sold during the month.

               8) In the Crush Report, the lastest crush sold should appear on top and older after that.


               9)On Reporting Abuse. The message, ' Report added successfully' should be replaced with
                      "Thank you for reporting Abuse. It will be reviewed by the Moderator and appropriate action will be taken within the next 24 hours."

                       This is FIXED.But instead of showing the above message for 2 to 3 sec. we should show a prompt
                      so that the user gets more time to read it properly. In that prompt 'OK' should be available and on tapping
                      OK in that prompt, the prompt message should minimize. Applicable for both Android and iOS.

                10) Online Status color should appear Dark Blue in both the Apps in all the relevant places.

                    Please change it to Green Color/ Grapes color.


               11)6) When we try to Report Abuse to the Admin by selecting the ' Other' option
                  to write something in the text field, the text field gets hidden and the UI does not appear
                  correctly. screenshot attached.
                Also, when we select 'Other' and then without wrting anyting in the text field if we try to report
               then it shows incorrect message. " Please select Report reason type"

               we should show the message as :  "Please explain your reason for reporting"

               12) Either in the Chat Screen or in Matches screen, it is not showing the Online Status.
                     ( Onine Status should be in Green color/ Grapes color )

               13) In the Menu ...' CHAT ' badge icon for the unread messages/ Received messages  DO NOT  appear.

               14) When we share location, we should send just the map and not the entire address with latitude and longitude.


               15) In the one to one chat screen, the background color of the text should be Blue and Orange.
                     Right Side (Blue)....this is for sent messages background.
                     Left Side (Orange)... this is for the received messages Background.  screenshot attached.

               16) In the messages screen, (where all the messages from the different users is available),
                     only one line of the text should appear along with TIME STAMP
                     If instead of text, the message is Photo then Photo icon should appear.
                     ( Please check WhatsApp for more on this)

               17) All Unread messages under the Messages screen should appear with Badge and when the messages
                      is read then the badge icon should disappear.

               18) In the chat screen, the previously type words for faster typing should appear just above the keyboard.
                     screenshot attached.


                      Please check and let me know in case of any doubts.
